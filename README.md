### HtmlLayouts

This repo contains some HTML layouts that I learnt from the book [CSS In Depth](https://www.manning.com/books/css-in-depth). The layouts present here are created using float, flex and grid system.

The available layouts are:
- [Just Float Layout](https://github.com/pallavJha/htmlLayouts/blob/master/making-sense-of-floats/float_left_layout.html)
- [A Grid System, like Bootstrap, using Float](https://github.com/pallavJha/htmlLayouts/blob/master/making-sense-of-floats/grid_systems.html)
