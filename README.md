### HtmlLayouts

This repo contains some HTML layouts that I have learned from the book [CSS In Depth](https://www.manning.com/books/css-in-depth). The layouts present here are created using `float`, `flex` and `grid` system. I chose this book because I wanted to learn the layout principles and practices used by the designers and the frontend developers. The most important section for all the layouts are the CSS around them and I've used internal(or embedded) CSS style to keep the number of files low.

The available layouts are:
- [Just Float Layout](https://github.com/pallavJha/htmlLayouts/blob/master/making-sense-of-floats/float_left_layout.html)
- [A Grid System, like Bootstrap, using Float](https://github.com/pallavJha/htmlLayouts/blob/master/making-sense-of-floats/grid_systems.html)
